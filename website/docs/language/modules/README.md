- 👀 := set of Terraform configuration files in 1! single directory 👀
    - every Terraform configuration is part of a module
- === Collection of files kept together in a directory
  - `.tf` & / or
  - `.tf.json`
- allows
  - organize configuration
    - make easier
      - navigate
      - understand
      - update
    - via
      - directories
      - workspaces
  - re-use configuration
    - === modules can be reused (public if you publish it / private)
  - encapsulate configuration into distinct logical components
    - 👀module names are unique 👀
  - provide consistency & ensure best practices
  - self service
- Type of modules
  - **root module**
    - := resources defined in `.tf` files in the **main working directory**
      - Note: ⚠️files / defined in subfolders are sub modules⚠️
    - ≥ 1 root module / Terraform configuration
      - 👁️at least 👁️ existing the root module 
  - **child modules**
    - := module ← which is called by — another module
      - *Example:* root module — can call → another modules
    - once the module is found →
      - loads it
      - process it
    - rules
      - multiple times can be called / same configuration
      - multiple configurations — can use — same child module
  - **local module**
    - := module which is loaded from the local filesystem
  - **remote module**
    - := module which is loaded from a remote source
    - *Example:* Terraform Registry, SCV, HTTP URLs, Terraform Cloud, Terraform Enterprise
- best practices
  - === (in programming languages) libraries / packages / modules
    - → same benefits
  - `terraform-<PROVIDER>-<NAME>`
    - provider naming
    - Follow it previously to publish it
  - Design your configuration from the scratch, to add modules
  - Use it, although it’s used just by you and no idea to publish it
  - Look for existing one’s in Terraform Registry
